Laboratory Exercise 2: MySQL Functions, Group By, Order By and Constraints
The activity involved MySQL Functions, Group By, Order By and Constraints which is new to me but with the help of the functions provided I was able to do it. It was a fun task and it really enhaces the students skills in terms of creating,manipulating and displaying the contents of database.
